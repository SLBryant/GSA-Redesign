                        <h1>Recovery Act: Federal Buildings Fund Investments</h1>
                        <p>This map shows where GSA is spending its $5.5 billion in funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to convert federal buildings to high-performance green buildings and build new, energy-efficient federal buildings, courthouses and land ports of entry.</p>

                        <p>These projects will deliver lasting progress toward modernizing the nation's infrastructure, reducing the federal government's consumption of energy and water and increasing the use of clean and renewable sources of energy.<br>
                            &nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Click on a project or state to see GSA's spending to date, measured in Obligations and Outlays.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Obligations are the total value of all contracts awarded on the projects. Contract awards trigger the start of work on a project.</li>

                            <li>Outlays are the total value of payments made to contractors for work they have already completed.</li>
                        </ul>
